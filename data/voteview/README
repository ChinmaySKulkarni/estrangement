Senator rollcall data has been downloaded from voteview.com:

http://www.voteview.com/downloads.asp#PARTYSPLITSDWNL

The script download_raw_data.sh downloads the raw data as supplied by voteview.
This has been saved in the senate_rollcall_raw directory.

The rollcall.py script processes the data to create network snapshots as
described in the estrangement paper. It can process the senate as well as the
house rollcall data. The data is not cleanly separated into fields by delimiters
such as a comma, space or tab. Several heuristics were thus needed to process
the data and cross check the parsed results. The processed data has been saved
in senate_rollcall dir.

The rollcall.py script also uses the files senate_icpsr.txt and house_icpsr.txt
that have been downloaded from http://www.voteview.com/icpsr.htm
